# SLOTCAR STARTLIGHT "Bären(n)keller" 🚦

## Project Overview 🏎️

In a private cellar bar that has been in existence for over two generations, originally named "Bärenkeller," a CARRERA® digital 132 racetrack was set up, and the first races were held. This quickly gained popularity among friends and acquaintances. As a result, the racetrack was gradually expanded, and possible extensions were discussed.

The idea of creating a custom starting light emerged because the original CARRERA® Startlight (30354) could not bridge three lanes (two lanes + pit lane). Additionally, the custom STARTAMPEL should not only display the start sequence with red lights but also indicate the race operation with green LEDs, the safety car/pace car operation, and a false start.

The idea was quickly taken up, the data signal was analyzed with an oscilloscope and data logger, and the development of hardware, software, and housing design was initiated.

In reference to the "Bärenkeller," which was renamed "Bären(n)keller" due to the expansion of the CARRERA® digital 132 racetrack, the custom starting light was also named "STARTAMPEL 'Bären(n)keller'."

The STARTAMPEL "Bären(n)keller" was so well received that the developer decided to produce a small quantity as "prototypes" and make the development available for non-commercial use.
